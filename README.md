<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This repository explores the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics. The 2HDM introduces an additional Higgs doublet, leading to five physical Higgs bosons: two neutral scalars (h, H), one neutral pseudoscalar (A), and two charged Higgs bosons (H⁺, H⁻). This model provides a framework to study phenomena such as CP violation, flavor-changing neutral currents, and electroweak baryogenesis.</p>
